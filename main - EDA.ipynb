    "The group would be working on a K-means clustering model for the Five Big Personality traits dataset. To give a brief overview of our task, the goal is to cluster the dataset based on the personality traits in the Big Five Personality Model or the Five-Factor model. The Big Five Personality Model or the Five-Factor Model is used for grouping or clustering people based on personality traits. The model uses common descriptors of common languages. This test is mainly used for career assessment since this gives people more insight in how they react in different situations. In addition, this test uses the Big-Five Factor Markers from the International Personality Item Pool, developed by Goldberg. These are commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche.\n",

    "1. **Extraversion (or Extroversion)** which can be identified as someone who gets motivated or energized in the company of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emotional Stability or Neuroticism** is a physical and emotional response to stress and perceived threats in someoneâ€™s daily life. This is mostly characterized by sadness or moodiness.\n",
    "3. **Agreeableness** - these people tend to have high or prosocial behaviors. Moreover, People who exhibit high agreeableness will show signs of trust, altruism, kindness, and affection\n",
    "4. **Conscientiousness** - includes having high levels of thoughtfulness, good impulse control, and goal-directed behaviors\n",
    "5. **Openness** - These people are eager to learn and experience new things. They are imaginative and insightful.\n"

However, dimensionality-reduction would have a minimal trade-off to the accuracy of the result. Here, we use PCA to visualize the personality clusters. To do this, we will be reducing the features from 50 (the number of questions) to 2 `n_components`. This is for us to visualize the graph in a 2D-plane."
